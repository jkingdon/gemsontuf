To use the C->Ruby module


irb -I .
require 'GemsOnTuf'
tuf = GemsOnTuf::Tuf.new
working = tuf.configure("configfile") #should return true unless there was an error
working = tuf.urlOpen("http://url.com") #should also return true if there was no error




I am not sure if it is necessary to make them return bool values but for now that's how it's setup once we start implementing
I'll have a better idea of what would be more useful



NOTE: Line 6 from above did not work as Tuf.new calls Tuf.initialize which calls Tuf.configure.
The GemsOnTuf interface requires three arguments as such:
Py_TUF_configure(char* tuf_intrp_json, char* p_repo_dir, char* p_ssl_cert_dir)

Example:
tuf = GemsOnTuf::TUF.new(filename="/path/to/tuf.interposition.json","./","./")
