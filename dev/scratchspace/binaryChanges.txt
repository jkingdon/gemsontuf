changes that need to be made 

add global 
int length;
and 
extern int length;


the following code needs to be added 
this changes the PyObject* into a char*
it also saves the length which is required by ruby 

args = PyTuple_New( 1 );
arg0 = http_resp;
PyTuple_SetItem(args, 0, arg0);
    
int i = PyString_Size( http_resp );

char* resp;
    
if ( !PyArg_ParseTuple( args, "s#", &resp, &i) ) {
	PyErr_Print();
	return NULL;
}
length = i;


In the cRuby code to get a binary string to Ruby we need to change
any rb_str_new2( char ) to
rb_str_new( char, length );
