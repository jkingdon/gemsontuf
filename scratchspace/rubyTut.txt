To use the C->Ruby module


irb -I .
require 'GemsOnTuf'
tuf = GemsOnTuf::Tuf.new
working = tuf.configure("configfile") #should return true unless there was an error
working = tuf.urlOpen("http://url.com") #should also return true if there was no error




I am not sure if it is necessary to make them return bool values but for now that's how it's setup once we start implementing
I'll have a better idea of what would be more useful
